# Hi :wave:
If you're reading this it's likely that we're on the same team, you may be a new member or we may have already worked together, I thought it would be a good idea to codify my management style and values so you know what to expect from me and what I'd expect from you.

# My Style
* **Default to Transparency** - You should always know the _why_. You should have a clear sense of the motivations behind decisions and know why we're doing what were doing
* **Good intentions** - I will always have the best intentions at heart, and expect others to as well. I belive that people are trying to do the best by others but sometimes dont think through full consequences
* **Freedom and safety** - I will provide you with the freedom to do your job, I don't believe in micromanagement and I don't believe I know how to do your job better than you. I'll also provide you with safety to make mistakes. _"Too err is human"_
* **Accountability** - I belive being accountable means being able to give an account of how decisions were made, to own the decisions and understand them.

# What I Value
I enjoy individuals working well together and as such I think the best teams demostrate the following:

* **Empathy** - People should care about those around them. I don't value the loan rockstar developer. If you solve a problem all by yourself you should be concerned with brining what you learned back to the team
* **Self care** - Work should never be the most important thing, be self aware about what values you have and what you need to be healthy
* **Trust** - I trust people to do their best work and to want to do their best work. I trust people to be honest and open with me
* **Marathon not a sprint** - I'll never force you to work late or start early. You can always say no to meetings outside of 9-5. Go home, do other things. Come back refreshed and give me your all tomorrow.


# What to expect from me
* **Coaching** - I can't guarentee I know the answer but you can always come to me to help you find the right questions to ask. I'm a big believer in coaching and will help you get your best.
* **Open Feedback** - You should always be able to ask for feedback, and should always have a space to let me know your feedback
* **Regular catch ups** - You should be able to catch up with me regularly, I'll never cancel our meetings (we may have to reschedule occasionally) our catch ups are your meetings you have control of those agendas.
* **Open door** - you can always interrupt me and find me, I'll always make time for you.
* **I will help you grow** - I will aim that you achieve your personal goals, that you can grow into whatever direction you want to

# How to best communicate with me
* **Be honest** - talk to me about what you're thinking, tell me what's on your mind. I can't help otherwise. If you disagree with me tell me.
* **Talk face to face** - I'm always happy to jump on a call. Always.

# How to help me
* **Feedback works both ways** - You need to let me know how I'm doing. If something isn't working for you let me know and we can correct.
* **Be open and honest** - I will make mistakes, tell me when you see one and help me get better. Equally let me help you by telling me what's up.
* **Be accountable** - If you take something on, tell me how it went. If something goes wrong tell me, as soon as it goes awry. Be prepared to tell me how decisions were made and for me to challenge you to learn from them.

# What people missunderstand about me
* **I'm not a natural extrovert** - I tend to be loud and outgoing and can hold a conversation but I have to push myself to get into those moments. I find myself deeply uncomfortable about strangers and can seem reserved, please don't let that put you off, come and say hi.
* **I rarely _know_ the answer** -  I love to investigate problems though so please bring me your problems, we can investigate them together

# Some other things you might like to know
I've done a few personality type tests in my time, and each one gives some good insight into things that make me tick and gives you some more depth to understanding me.
