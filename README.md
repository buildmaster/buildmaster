# My User Manual

## What I value
There are many aspects of being a great member of a team but these are some core values I try to hold myself too. If you ever feel I'm breaking these I'd want to know as soon as possible

* I value transparency and honesty. You should always feel like you know why decisions are being made. You should feel like you've been given all the information I have to work with and  the why is my job, the how is your job.
